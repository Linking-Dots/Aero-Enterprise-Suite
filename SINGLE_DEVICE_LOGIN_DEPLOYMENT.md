# Single Device Login Deployment Checklist

## Current Status
✅ Login is working (middleware temporarily disabled)
⏳ Ready to deploy single device login feature

## Files to Upload to Live Server

### 1. Core Middleware & Services
- `app/Http/Middleware/SingleDeviceLoginMiddleware.php`
- `app/Services/DeviceTrackingService.php`
- `app/Models/UserDevice.php`

### 2. Updated Files
- `app/Http/Kernel.php` (middleware registration)
- `app/Models/User.php` (device relationships and methods)

### 3. Database Migrations
- `database/migrations/2025_08_23_XXXXXX_create_user_devices_table.php`
- `database/migrations/2025_08_23_XXXXXX_add_single_device_login_to_users_table.php`

### 4. Admin Interface (Optional)
- `app/Http/Controllers/UserDeviceController.php`
- `resources/js/Pages/UserDeviceManagement.jsx`
- Updated `resources/js/Pages/UsersList.jsx`
- Frontend assets (run `npm run build`)

### 5. Routes (if using admin features)
- Updated `routes/web.php` with device management routes

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Upload Files
Upload all the files listed above to your live server.

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
```

### Step 3: Run Migrations
```bash
php artisan migrate --force
```

### Step 4: Clear Caches
```bash
php artisan optimize:clear
```

### Step 5: Optimize for Production
```bash
php artisan optimize
```

### Step 6: Re-enable Middleware
In `routes/web.php`, change line 49 back from:
```php
Route::middleware(['auth', 'verified'])->group(function () {
```
to:
```php
Route::middleware(['auth', 'verified', 'single_device'])->group(function () {
```

### Step 7: Test
1. Clear browser cache
2. Try logging in from different devices
3. Test admin controls (if deployed)

## Features After Deployment

### For Users:
- Single device login enforcement (when enabled)
- Automatic logout from previous devices
- Device tracking and session management

### For Admins:
- Per-user single device login toggle
- Device history viewing
- Device reset capabilities
- Device statistics monitoring

## Rollback Plan
If issues occur:
1. Remove `'single_device'` from the middleware array in routes
2. Run `php artisan optimize:clear`
3. The system will work as before

## Notes
- Currently middleware is temporarily disabled to fix login
- Users can login normally until feature is fully deployed
- No existing functionality is affected
- Database changes are backward compatible
